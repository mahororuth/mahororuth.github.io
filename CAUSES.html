        <h3>CAUSES OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE</h3>
            <p>
                <b>The unequal status of men and women is the primary cause of gender-based violence.</b><br>
                <b>This inequality includes beliefs that women should be economically dependent on men,</b><br>
                <b> and that women and children are a manâ€™s possessions and under his control.</b><br>
