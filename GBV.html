            <p>
                <b>Gender-based violence refers to acts that</b><br>
                <b>hurt, threaten, violate, force or restrict someone,</b><br>
                <b>and which are based in a gendered power structure.</b><br>
                <b>This gendered power structure uses perceptions</b><br> 
                <b>of masculinity and femininity to create a rank order</b><br> 
                <b>of gender, resulting in a power imbalance</b><br>
